# EpilepSya2    ---Improved Version
This version is more efficient for users (interface use) ,now pipeline steps are better described for patients and doctors :
It returns to user to train and select best model one time then run rpedictions via uploading csv files to know if this person is Epileptic,Healthy or Suspect(there is an ambiguity)
![these are the steps of our pipeline implmenetation_ - visual selection (2)](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c2e1280a-ef4b-4ff8-8815-5ff2dc1f01cb)

A further deploymant would be efficient .
